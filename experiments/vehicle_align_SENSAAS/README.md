# Fragment Alignment from VEHICLe with SENSAAS

The SENSAAS paper shows that alignment of fragments to molecules seems to work reasonably well. However, fragments have been taken from the same molecule they are being aligned to. Given the rather poor performance of `libmolgrid`-generated densities for alignment of small fragments, it is interesting to see how the original SENSAAS implementation performs in this case.
